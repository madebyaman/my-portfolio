            <h3>Similar Color Palette</h3>
            <p>This app generates a palette based on the colors you provide. This is done by keeping saturation and luminiosity constant, and getting random hue values.</p>

              <li>The app has been made by using Create React App</li>
              <li>It uses React Context API to manage state changes</li>

          <h2>Passionate about <span class="hl">Reactjs and beautiful design.</span><br>Advocate of <span class="hl">accessible apps.</span><br>Likes <span class="hl">running and watching cricket.</span></h2>
          <p>I am a web developer who loves building beautiful and accessible interfaces. I use Reactjs for majority of my work and highly recommend it because of its declarative nature.</p>
          <p>I initially started my career as a marketer and then switched to developer when exposed to programming. Because of my initial career, I am also very keen to develop apps that are conversion-friendly, fast and rank well in search engines.</p>
          <p>I care deeply about the apps being accessible part of the reason is because I am also disabled. I also like to make apps that are scalable and easily maintainable which is why I frequently make changes to my workflow. For example, I recently started using ITCSS(Inverted Triangle CSS) to make CSS scalable.</p>
